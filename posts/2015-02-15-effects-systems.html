<p>There’s a thing I’ve seen a lot in various comment threads about Haskell by new people. They hear all about how in Haskell side effects are documented and controlled at the type level and they get excited. Then they actually look through libraries and code examples and come to the conclusion “hey, wait, everything is just <code>IO</code>”.</p>
<p>It’s understandable. I certainly had similar thoughts as a newbie. I assumed there’d be one type for disk access, maybe another for network access, who knows? Now, it <em>is</em> true that you <em>can</em> do that sort of thing if you really want to. The interpreter patten with free monads come to mind. With this technique you can limit the means by which your application interacts with the outside world to a statically known, finite list of primitives that you can keep in one module. If you need high assurances about your test coverage or your attack surface, this is a major boon.</p>
<p>But its not the default. You have to actively choose to write an application this way. Contrast this to immutability; if you write application in Haskell you don’t have to go out of your way to get immutability in the same way you would in other languages. It’s free. The free monad, if you forgive the pun, isn’t free.</p>
<p>Plus, if <code>IO</code> had been split into different types by the Haskell committee would their choices of divisions make sense for you? Perhaps disk but no network makes sense for you? What about the next developer? What about in 20 years’ time? What if you were on some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file">weird operating system where everything is a file?</a></p>
<p>Generally the newbie is told to avoid writing things in <code>IO</code> as much as possible. The newbie the goes and tried this and finds it’s surprisingly easy to keep IO out of 90% a Haskell application and thus stops being a newbie.</p>
<p>If if every interaction with the outside world is just <code>IO</code>, is that it? <code>IO</code> or not <code>IO</code>, that is the question? Well, not quite. But first, let’s talk about a real problem that happened to me this week trying to do something in node.</p>
<h1 id="an-aside-into-config-loaded">An aside into config loaded</h1>
<p>We’ve been developing a particular app for a while and it was finally time to make it load it’s configuration properly (from an S3 bucket in Amazon, as it happens) rather than a file that <code>require</code>. And this is where we discovered our oversight. Even though we’d been good and tried to keep all our configurable values localised, we’d made the assumption that they could be loaded synchronously and that assumption had spread everywhere. Things like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="kw">var</span> config = <span class="fu">require</span>(<span class="st">&quot;config&quot;</span>);

<span class="co">//Do stuff with config</span></code></pre></div>
<p>were spread all over the place.</p>
<p>The first obvious solution is to hack the config.js so that it fetches the data from Amazon and returns it so the change is transparent to the rest of the code, caching subsequent calls to require, of course. Of course, if you know anything about node, you know that does not work. You fundamentally cannot wait on a asynchronous call to make it synchronous.</p>
<p>There is also a “maybe good enough” solution where the program entry point loads the config, caches it, and then calls the other requires that start things moving. Something like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="kw">var</span> configLoader = <span class="fu">require</span>(<span class="st">&quot;configLoader&quot;</span>);

<span class="co">/*</span>
<span class="co">//would throw an exception</span>
<span class="co">app = require(&quot;theApp&quot;);</span>
<span class="co">*/</span>

<span class="ot">configLoader</span>.<span class="fu">loadConfig</span>(<span class="kw">function</span>() {
    app = <span class="fu">require</span>(<span class="st">&quot;theApp&quot;</span>); <span class="co">//Works now</span>
    <span class="ot">app</span>.<span class="fu">startStuffHappening</span>();
});</code></pre></div>
<p><code>require(&quot;config&quot;)</code> works again but throws a nice informative error if the config happens to be not loaded. Oh, and every single test that implicitly relied on config being loaded now fails and needs to be rewritten.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the app can be in one of two states. At any one moment, config is either loaded or not. If it’s not loaded there are certain operations that simply cannot be done but the only way to find out that an operation needed the config to be loaded was at runtime, reading the documentation, or carefully examining the code and any code that code depends on.</p>
<h1 id="environments">Environments</h1>
<p>I can think of several other similar cases that come up in development: “this code assumes a pool of database connections has been made available”, “this code assumes a database transaction is in progress”, “this code assumes we are serving a http request”, and so on. This is the arena where using monads for tracking the environment starts to shine.</p>
<p>How would I solve the configuration problem? Well, as configuration is generally read only, the problem cries “reader monad” very loudly</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Config</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Config</span> {
<span class="ot">    foo ::</span> <span class="dt">Int</span>,
<span class="ot">    bar ::</span> <span class="dt">String</span>
}

<span class="kw">type</span> <span class="dt">ConfiguredT</span> m a <span class="fu">=</span> readerT <span class="dt">Config</span> m a

<span class="ot">getFoo ::</span> <span class="dt">Monad</span> m <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Config</span> m <span class="dt">Int</span>
getFoo <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span> config <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> ask
                     return <span class="fu">$</span> foo config</code></pre></div>
<p>The client code would look something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">usesFoo ::</span> <span class="dt">Monad</span> m <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Int</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Config</span> m <span class="dt">Int</span>
usesFoo x <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span> foo <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> getFoo
               return <span class="fu">$</span> foo <span class="fu">+</span> x</code></pre></div>
<p>The result is very clean. We don’t need to keep the config in some global variable somewhere and at the same time we don’t need to explicitly pass it around as a function argument.</p>
<p>Neat, and yet that’s almost not the point here. What’s wrong with config being in some global variable? It’s loaded once and then never changes. The real advantage is that the dependency on config is documented in the type signature. If I see something with a type ending <code>Config m a</code> I know for certain it uses the config. If I want to write a test for it, I’ll need to provide some test config. If I see <code>Config m a</code> popping up all over the place, I might start to wonder if too much of the code is directly depending on the config and if some refactoring might be in order to improve modularity.</p>
<h1 id="does-this-actually-get-used-haskell">Does this actually get used Haskell?</h1>
<p>The answer is yes, all over the place. Take the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent-2.1.1.4">persistent</a> package. You’ll see many function with type <code>MonadIO m =&gt; ReaderT backend m a</code>, which imply to run them you need <code>IO</code> capacity (makes sense right, we’re talking to a database out there in the real world) and a backend. <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/">Yesod</a> provides <code>Handler</code> and <code>Widget</code> types that both tell you that you are operating in the context of serving a Http request.</p>
<h1 id="environments-environments-everywhere.">Environments, environments everywhere.</h1>
<p>You can tell an idea is a good one when many people are having it independently. Dependency injection in Java comes to mind. The idea being that classes declare their dependencies with annotations and the dependency injection framework injects this dependencies at runtime.</p>
<p>It’s an idea I like in principle, though in practice (and I can only really say I’m familiar with Spring where) this amounts to all the code and tests needing to run in the container, lots of XML, and mystical annotations you need to ask the local Spring shaman about. Spring also only has a limited number of environments: singleton, prototype, request, session, global-session. Interestingly, these are laired, onion like, in the same way monad transforms end up. I don’t know if that’s significant, or just a coincidence.</p>
<p>Still, I think this shows that awareness of the environment you code runs in is important for making architectural decisions.</p>
<h1 id="meanwhile-back-in-the-real-world">Meanwhile, back in the real world…</h1>
<p>I settled for my global variable solution. The config is loaded asynchronously at program start up. The tests were easy to fix when I noticed that mocha accepts the argument <code>--require</code>. Once I knew that, it was easy to just write a file that loaded some fixed test config into that global variable synchronously before the tests run. It works fine and is good enough to get the job done. I worry that it won’t be clear to the maintenance programmer how the config is loaded in the tests but I guess I can put a note in the project documentation. It’s fine. I’m just sure it could be better.</p>
